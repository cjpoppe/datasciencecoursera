Week 3:Linking Git/GitHub and R Studio
Follow directions for how to install Git/SVN so that the Git tab shows up in the 
top right quadrant.

In Tools, Global Options, Git/SVN:
Git executable - C:/Users/Christine.Hodges/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/mingw64/bin/git.exe
SVN executable - C:/Users/Christine.Hodges/Desktop/R/John Hopkins Coursera/Course 1/HelloWorld.md
SSh Key - C:/Users/Christine.Hodges/.ssh/id_ed25519

The key is also listed on your GitHub account and thus, the two are linked. Make
sure both match if there is ever a key problem.

Create a new project to be able to save to a repository you've made on GitHub
1. New Project -> Version Control -> Git -> add link for repository from GitHub,
name the project with a title, and add the place on your desktop where you want 
to save the folder to. Create project
2. Open a new markdown or quarto file and add script or info
3. Save the note within your new project directory
4. This file will now show up in the upper right quadrant under the Git tab
5. First step is to STAGE the file. Click the box next to the file
6. Second step is to COMMIT the file. Click commit, a new window opens. You can 
add a comment here about the file and here is where it shows what changes you've 
made to the document from the last time you've worked on it
7. Click Commit and close the window.
**Now file has been created, saved, staged, and committed. Next, is to PUSH the 
changes of your file to GitHub repository
8.Within the commit screen, at the top right corner, it says "Push. Click this and 
then go to GitHub, click in your repository and see that the file and your changes
have been  "pushed" to your repository and are now saved.
